# PID-Control-Mass-Spring-Damper

Simulating and analyzing a PID-controlled mass-spring-damper system using MATLAB and Simulink.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a PID controller for a second-order mechanical system. The aim is to improve system response using classical control methods. Both MATLAB scripts and a Simulink model are provided.

## System Model

The physical system is described by the second-order differential equation:


Where:  
- m = 1 kg  
- b = 10 Ns/m  
- k = 20 N/m

Transfer Function:


## PID Controller

The PID controller used has the following structure:

Tuned parameters:

- **Kp = 350**  
- **Ki = 300**  
- **Kd = 50**
